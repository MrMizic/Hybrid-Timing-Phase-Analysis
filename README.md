# Hybrid Timing and Phase Analysis

This repository contains a technical review document analyzing timing, phase-alignment, and jitter constraints that arise when classical control systems interface with coherence-sensitive subsystems.

The scope is intentionally limited to abstract models and known physical constraints. No specific architecture, implementation, or commercial system is proposed.
## Contents

- `Technical_Review_Timing_Phase_Interface` — Primary technical review document (PDF)
- `REFERENCES.md` — Reference list supporting the analysis

## Scope and Intent

This material is provided solely for technical scrutiny and discussion.
It does not constitute a system disclosure, commercial offering, or request for collaboration.

## How to Review

1. Read the PDF in `paper/`
2. Cross-check assumptions and definitions against `REFERENCES.md`
3. Provide critique on: (i) model assumptions, (ii) constraint regimes, (iii) failure modes
