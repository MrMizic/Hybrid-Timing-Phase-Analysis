# Hybrid Timing and Phase Analysis

This repository contains a technical analysis examining timing, phase-alignment, and jitter constraints that arise when classical control systems interface with coherence-sensitive subsystems.

The work is intentionally scoped to abstract models and known physical constraints. No specific architecture, implementation, or commercial system is proposed.
